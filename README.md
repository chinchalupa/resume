## Summary

I am a computer scientist who is deeply passionate about exploring the physical bounds of computing and the complex orchestrations and applications of computing. Through my education at Rose-Hulman, I got a sweet, first taste for the potential of computers through building operating systems, designing processors, and exploring a wide range of software applications. Since then, my professional work has extended to areas such as embedded systems for tractors, database and network orchestration for public displays, and service delivery for file systems via cloud providers has provided a plethora of experience fueling my passion for the field. My recent interests have brought me into new realms of computing such as photorealistic texturing and shading, quantum simulation, and virtual reality development.
